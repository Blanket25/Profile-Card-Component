## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

## Acknowledgments

This is actually the second time I'm doing this project. The first time was before starting the Web Developer Bootcamp at Migracode, and this time is after finishing my HTML/CSS modules there. I really feel more comfortable coding this time and I understand everything that I'm doing.
